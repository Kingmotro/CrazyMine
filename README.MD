##CrazyMine
#### by nascnova
CrazyMine is a `minecraft minigame` which mixed
`Hypixel`'s famous pvp game `CrazyWall` and `ItsJerryAndHerry` 's
 famous game `MineFighter`.
###### In general it's `pvp` + `mine` + some `sexy rpg features`

Players spawn in a bounded cave, with a resource shop. Players dig ores, get ingots.
Ingots not only can be used to crafting items but also can be converted to `gold` 
. Golds like money, it can be used to buy things from resource shop.
 What things on sale in resources shop? I can't tell you because it's configurable.
 You can buy armor, buff, tools, weapon and so on. The last player/team alive is
 the winner.
